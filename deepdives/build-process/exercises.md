# Build Processes

## Choose your adventure
- Look at the examples in the webpack and gulp directories and choose which ever one you like. Use that for the rest of the exercises

## Tailor
- Copy the configuration file to your teams project, look at the included package.json to see a list of packages you will need to npm install. Change all the file names to make the system work with your project. Ask a ninja or instructor for help if you are getting bugs.

## Add Features
- Add a feature to the build process. I would suggest linting (checking your code for syntax or style issues) using jshint or eslint or es7 syntax or both.

## ES6 Concepts:
- Es6 (also known as es2015 or es harmony), added a ton of great features to javascript. [here](https://medium.com/sons-of-javascript/javascript-an-introduction-to-es6-1819d0d89a0f#.irhdrps3r) is a good introduction to the most useful features.  Think about how you could use these features in your project.

## Promises
- Es6 brought built in support for promises. [here](https://spring.io/understanding/javascript-promises) is a good article on what promies are and [here](http://www.datchley.name/es6-promises/http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html) is a good article on promises in es6. Try to rewrite one of your routes to use mongos [built-in](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html) promise support.
