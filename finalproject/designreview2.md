# Design Review 2
## Friday, April 15

### Format
Reviews will start at 3:30 in AC328 and three other classrooms in the AC, and you’ll present to 1-2 other teams and 1-2 teaching team members. The presentation can last up to 15 minutes, and you can use it to do whatever will be most helpful for you moving forward -- get feedback or advice, do a codesign, do a code review... up to you. The flexibility we’re giving you means that we trust you to use the time productively.

### Goals
Here’s what we hope the design review will do for the class:
- Facilitate inter-team communication -- if another team is doing something similar to what you’re doing, we want you to have the opportunity to help and learn from each other.
- Act as a check-in so you have incentive to get moving on your project right away
- Encourage you to spend time up front thinking about longer-term architecture decisions

### Content
We’d like to see a demo of your MVP (deployed if at all possible!) and we’d like you to describe what goals you have for the remainder of the project and how you’re planning to achieve them.

If you don’t have an MVP yet, let us know where you are and how you’re planning to proceed.

Beyond that, if you’d like to ask project-specific questions, if you’d like to showcase particular work you’ve done, or if there are any other ways you’d like to use the time -- feel free to do so!
