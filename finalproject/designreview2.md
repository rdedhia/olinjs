# Design Review 2

You will have **8 minutes** to present the following information:

- What progress have you made so far?
  - Proof-of-concepts/MVP demo!
- What are some problems you have run into? Are they still blocking you?
- What are you looking for feedback on?
- Are you progressing as scheduled? Have you had to make any modifications to previous plans?
- What are your next steps?

There will be a few minutes at the end for questions and to collect feedback from the class and teaching team.

**Code Review:** Before you present, submit an email to the teaching team with an email to your Git repo. Include the following:
  - Point to some code that you are specifically proud of. (An awesome feature, a clean and organized routing table, a smart use of a design pattern, etc.)
  - Point to some code that you are less sure of and would like specific feedback on.
